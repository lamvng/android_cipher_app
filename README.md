# Android Cipher App

This application will cipher and decipher texts based on [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) and [Vigenere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) algorithms on user input. The aim is to practice basic Android skills during my University course project. The following Android terms and techniques are used:

  * Activities;
  * Intents;
  * Parcelable;
  * JSON;
